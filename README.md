Welcome to the Github site of Linux: The Textbook, 2nd edition!

Starting in September of 2018- you will find all long program source code, 
weblinks, and errata.

Advisory information will be updated regularly, and will give
important changes in our representative Linux systems since the printing of the book.

So far, we have added program source code in Linux-compatible text
format for the following chapters, so you don't have to type in program listings shown in the
printed book and the W chapters  that are more than a few lines long!

Chapters 18,W19,W22,W27, and W28

If you follow the instructions in the book Preface you will be able 
to "pull" everything from this Github site to a git-enabled directory on your own computer! 
Alternatively, you can just download the above-provided materials via a web
browser interface.

You can also report any errors you find in the printed book here.
Just email bobk48@gmail.com, and we will evaluate your error reports
or any other requests you make, and take appropriate action.

Have fun, and keep playing!
