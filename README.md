Advisory information will be updated regularly, appearing on this README page in numerical order
from bottom to top, oldest to most recent, giving important news about issues related to
the content of this repository, and also keeping you up to date on
important changes to our representative Linux systems since the printing of the book.

If you follow the instructions in the printed book Preface, you will be able 
to "pull" everything from this Github site to a git-enabled directory on your own computer! 
Alternatively, you can just download the above-provided materials via a web
browser interface.

Mansoor and I would greatly appreciate if you would also report any errors you find in the printed book here.
Just email bobk48@gmail.com, and we will evaluate your error reports,
or any other requests you make, and take appropriate action.

Have fun, and keep playing!

Advisory 3- For your convenience, we have added the In-Chapter Exercise Solutions for Chapters 2,3,17,18,W19,W22,W23,W24,W25,W26,W27,W28, and W29 in the folder ICE.
A complete set of these for all printed book chapters and W chapters will be available at the above listed CRC website for the book,
and when that complete set is available, we will post an advisory here.

Advisory 2- We have now made advisory documents available in a folder. Our first installation into that folder is a .docx file that details how to install LXD on a CentOS 7.5 system with a ZFS backing store, and also how to give subsequently-created LXD containers a macvlan interface, so that they have an IP address in the same sub-net as the host automatically assigned to them by a DHCP server on your LAN. Check it out if you're a CentOS user!

Advisory 1- The Caveat shown in Chapter W23, Section 2.1 is no longer true! Thanks to the efforts of the developer of LXD, Stephane Graber, instructions for installing LXD on CentOS 7.5 1804 (core) are available at the following URL-

https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-on-centos-7/1250/5

Follow these and you can then proceed to use CentOS 7.5 to accomplish what is shown in Chapter W23 on virtualization in Linux. The instructions also include installation of ZFS on CentOS 7.5, and allow integration of ZFS with your LXD containers. Of course, that integration is covered in Chapter W23 for Debian-family systems, and you will have to adapt what is shown there for CentOS.
