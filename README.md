Welcome to the Github site of Linux: The Textbook, 2nd edition!

Starting in September of 2018- you will find In-Chapter Exercise Solutions, 
weblinks, and errata, all in Word .doc and .pdf formats.

Advisory information will be updated regularly, and will give
important changes in our representative Linux systems since the printing of the book.

You will also find program source code in Linux-compatible text
format here, so you don't have to type in program listings shown in the
printed book that are more than a few lines long!

If you follow the instructions in the book Preface you will be able 
to "pull" everything from this Github site to a git-enabled directory on your own computer! Alternatively, you can just download the above-provided materials via a web
browser interface.

You can also report any errors you find in the printed book here.
Just email bobk48@gmail.com, and we will evaluate your error reports
or any other requests you make, and take appropriate action.
